# Ada Constraint_Error Handling
This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: accessing an array element outside its defined bounds.  The `Constraint_Error` exception is raised in such cases. This repository shows how to handle this exception using exception handling.

The `bug.ada` file contains the code with the error, while `bugSolution.ada` provides a solution using exception handling.
